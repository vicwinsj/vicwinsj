Hi, I'm Victor, a newly educated front-end developer with a background from journalism and content writing/translation. I like to unfold myself both mentally and physically â€“ through for instance exercise, hiking, traveling, reading and creating. :sparkles:

### This is me ###

:green_heart: Strive for authenticity  
:cherry_blossom: Into aesthetic appealing creations  
:high_brightness: Curious about new ideas  
:white_check_mark: Enjoy solving problems
